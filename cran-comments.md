## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 3 notes

The 3 notes are:

* `New submission` — expected for a first-time submission
* `unable to verify current time` — local environment issue, not reproducible on CRAN servers
* `Files 'README.md' or 'NEWS.md' cannot be checked without 'pandoc' being installed` — pandoc not installed locally, not a package issue

## Downstream dependencies

None — this is a new package.
